Player A and B , agree to play several games.

Game rules:-

1. A game never ends in a draw.

2. Player "A" starts first in the first game.

3. Player who starts a game has probability "P" of winning that game.

4. The one who loses starts the new game.

Everyone knows no one settles after losing a game. One more game please!!, is the word of mouth whenever someone loses. This way people end up playing many games.

Now A wants to know the probability that he will win the Nth game.

Input:
First line - probability P.
Second line - Q ( Number of query ).
Next Q lines, each have an integer N.  

Output:
For each query output the probability that A will win Nth game.
Output the answer rounded to 4 decimal places. While rounding to 4 decimal place 0.12345 becomes 0.1235, 0.43531 becomes 0.4353 and 0.32768 becomes 0.3277.

Constraint :-

0.0 <= P <= 1.0 
0 < Q <= 200000
0 < N <= 1000000

Sample Input:-
0.2
3
1
4
7
Sample Output:-
